Multiplayer Sci-Fi Real Time Strategy game


Well, I always wanted to do this and i finally started making my own remake of Fallen Haven with multiplayer capabilities. That's what this great game lacked, the possibility to play with friends. I already started and I basically have the whole motor and most of the logic coded in Python using FIFE (http://www.fifengine.net/).

For the moment I would like to have a clone of the game (not counting arts), with a very basic play-by-email kind of multiplayer (load -> play turn -> save -> send).
